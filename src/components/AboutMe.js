        text="I am currently working within the CICS Customer in Production (CiP) testing team, where we test the full product each release as a customer would do, 
        raising defects where necessary and advising the development team on issues that are found. I've set up transaction processing systems from a 
        bank’s perspective, providing feedback on how the process could be improved from the customer’s point of view, and have created an ID generation program with 
        customizable constraints as part of a project to improve the reliability of client connectivity.  In addition, I 
        have gained experience with IBM’s AI offerings, experimenting with agents and developing Python tools to support their implementation."></ExperienceBox>

        text="Worked developing new features and fixing issues with a network multiplayer Minecraft server,
        along with a team of developers. I wrote code for new features, gamemodes, functionality, and tested them both by myself and
         by others, before having them released and maintaining them where issues arose. I've been working with TwistMC
        on and off for 5 years, and have improved my ability in OO and Java hugely as a result - alongside 
        the skills to plan, design and test a project mostly independently."></ExperienceBox>
